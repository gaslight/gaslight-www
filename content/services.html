<ul>

<li>Code Review

<li>Performance Review
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Security Review
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Design/Architecture Discussion
<p>Are you thinking SOA, Messaging or Mobile, how about releasing to a Grid or Cloud distribution, are you limited to a client application and want ideas on how to migrate it to the web. What are the pro's and con's of the solutions and so many more? Gaslight Software members have built them all and we know whether we should have or not.</p>
</li>

<li>Start-up Company Review
<p>Gaslight Software is privileged to have programmers that have lived through the rise and fall of startup companies. Ed likes to say that he has killed 3 already and is looking forward to the next while Bill and Dewayne are doggedly focused on their <a href="http://budgetsketch.com">Budget Sketch</a> dream. Now we are all growing Gaslight Software as another new venture.</p>
<p>If you are working on a dream of your own and are interested in some outside opinions we can help. Whether it is just the occasional discussion, finding the best staff to give your technology the start it needs or letting us help us help you setup a technical review board to steer you around the hard times.</p>

</li>

<li>Problem Project Review
<p></p>
</li>

<li>Training
<p>We have done a variety of focused trainings over the years, usually customized to what is needed. We are not training specialists and would not take on a large scale training. However, if you are looking for small group introductions or deep dives into a particular technology we can help. We do not offer training on subjects that we do not work with day to day, we will not study material before class just to save you from reading the book yourself. We will probably not do introductions to new languages because professional trainers will do a better job for you. That is a lot of training we will not do.</p>

<p>We find it very beneficial for teams to learn about planning and programming techniques to help improve the motivation and empowerment of the teams and reduce the bug rates that are produced.</p>

<p>If your projects tech lead does not know the largest Cyclomatic Complexity in your code base, you could use a short introduction into code quality monitoring and management techniques.</p>

<p>If your team members can't answer the question "When is your code going to be released?" then you could use a discussion around team empowerment and transparent planning techniques.</p>

<p>There are lots of moving parts in a technical team and how to keep it flowing can be tricky. We can help.</p>
