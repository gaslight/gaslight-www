	  <p>Yes, we've read the books.  Some of us have even had some training. More than that, we've
            lived agile projects. We've been on agile teams.  We've led agile teams.  We've introduced agile
            to big organizations. We've been there and done that so many times our whole wardrobe is made
            up of agile tee shirts.</p>
